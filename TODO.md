#	TODO:
#
##	1. Check what primitive method types are for a basic funtionality of the system.
#
##	2. Build a server according to a client's most usuable languages:
##	RUST: GO, GNO (for smart contracts), TYPESCRIPT (TS -> JS -> TS: Mind that we can implement JS,
##	which is already in use in TS convention architecture.) For that we can use it same as
##	fly.io eg.(https://github.com/fly-apps/go-example) and firecracker had already been used. https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker
##
##	gRPC:
